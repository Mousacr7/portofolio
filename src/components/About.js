    <h1>Hi, I'm Musa</h1>
    <h2>I'm a Frontend Developer</h2>
    <p>
      I build modern, responsive web apps using JavaScript and React.
      With a background in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, I bring both logic and creativity to every project.

      My work includes a weather app, currency converter, and a task tracker â€” all using real APIs and localStorage.
      I'm currently learning full-stack development to expand my skills.

      I enjoy solving real problems through clean, functional code, and I'm passionate about improving UI/UX.
      My goal is to grow as a freelance developer and build meaningful digital experiences.
